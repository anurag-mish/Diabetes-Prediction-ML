# Diabetes Prediction – Machine Learning Classifier (CIS 412)

This project explores binary classification to predict the likelihood of diabetes using health-related attributes. The analysis is based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, processed using pandas and modeled in scikit-learn. Completed as part of CIS 412: Business Machine Learning at Arizona State University.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Loaded and explored `diabetes.csv` to understand feature relationships and balance in outcome classes.
- Cleaned missing values and visualized correlations between predictors and target.
- Trained a **classification model** to predict diabetes presence.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
